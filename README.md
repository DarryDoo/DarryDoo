# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Not quite a boomer, missed it by 11 months. Not a developer, just hacking my way through life.


## Current role: 
+ over-the-road truck driver since 2004 -- I doubt I'll ever work in IT again!

## Previous roles:
+ worked as a senior 3rd-level support specialist for a large Canadian company, 2000-2004
+ worked in Operations, 1st-level support, then desktop support for a large multinational company, 1994-1999

## Education:
+ some community college courses for 2 years, which I then taught at that same college (different campus)
+ mostly self-taught -- a quick-and-dirty approach, hardly any structure or collaborative skills

## Personal:
+ father of 4, grandfather of 7
